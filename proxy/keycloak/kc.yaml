# This is for easy creation and setup of a test Keycloak instance that can
# support both a list based access control and a single-patient based
# SMART-on-FHIR app (in two separate realms).
#
# The Keycloak instance uses port 9080 for http and 9443 for https traffic by
# default (configurable through environment variables, see below). Note
# there is no valid certificate set for this instance and hence it should never
# be used in production.
#
# The relevant environment variables are (see `keycloak_setup.sh` for details
# and `.env` file for default values):
#
# HTTP_PORT: the port on the host machine mapped to Keycloak's http port;
#  default: 9080
#
# HTTPS_PORT: same as above for https; default: 9443
#
# KEYCLOAK_USER: the admin user for the Keycloak instance; default: "admin"
#
# KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: the password for the admin user; default: "adminpass"
#
# TEST_REALM: the name of the realm for list based access; default: "test"
#
# TEST_USER: the username used for both realms; default: "testuser"
#
# TEST_PASS: the password for the test user; default: "testpass"
#
# SMART_REALM: if non-empty, it is the name of the SoF realm; leave this unset
#  if SoF support is needed; note there is still a default SoF realm configured
#  in this case which can be ignored; default: "test-smart"
#
# SMART_PATIENT_ID: the id of the Patient resource for the created user;
#  default: "8eb95e44-627f-4899-9ea3-097d4f7be57b"
